# Lesson 1 - Homework

There are five exercises for this weekâ€™s homework:
Exercise 1: Create a string that consists of the first letter of each word in
the list of Strings provided. HINT: Use a StringBuilder to construct the
result.

Exercise 2: Remove the words that have odd length s from the list.
HINT: Use one of the new methods from JDK 8.

Exercise 3: Replace every word in the list with its upper case equivalent.
HINT: Again, use one of the new methods from JDK 8.

Exercise 4: Convert every key-value pair of the map into a string and
append them all into a single string, in iteration order. HINT: Again, use a
StringBuilder to construct the result String. Use one of the new JDK 8
methods for Map.

Exercise 5: Create a new thread that prints the numbers from the list.
HINT: This is a straightforward Lambda expression.
